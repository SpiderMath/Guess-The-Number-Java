# Guess-The-Number-Java

> I made some fixes **after** the challenge finished. If you want to see the files when I just finished it, you can see that [here](https://github.com/SpiderMath/Guess-The-Number-Java/tree/465bd11a31be472a99a362525bbf3c884b991610)

> For your information, I have never worked on a Java Project before when coding this, and well I just knew `Hello, World!`. [Luckily I knew JavaScript or else I'd go crazy] So please pardon me for the pollution of your eyes by my code

I tided over this one, by the help of intellisense [however much I hate to admit this], so yeah, Visual Studio Code seems good for Java Development too ðŸ‘€ 

**Total Time Taken:** 15 minutes 48 seconds 18 miliseconds <br>
**Challenge Time:** 15 minutes <br>

Therefore I lost ðŸ˜¿ , but it was kinda fun anyways
